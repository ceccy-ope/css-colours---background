    <h1 id="H1">5 ways to motivate yourself</h1>
       <p>When we leave this world, we will ask ourselves one question: What’s different because I was here? And
    the answer to that question will be the difference that we made.The actions we took.</p>
       <p>Action will be all that matters.We could have made a difference every hour, everyday, if we had wanted to.</p>
       <p>So how do we do that? How do we motivate ourselves to get into action? How do we live a life of action and
    difference-making? I share 5 tips below.</p>

    <h2 id="H2">Get on your death bed</h2>
    <p>Clearly imagine yourself lying on your own death bed, and fully realize the feelings connected with dying and saying
    good-bye.</p>
    <p>Then mentally invite the people in your life who are important to you to visit your bedside, one
    at a time. </p>
    <p>As you visualize each friend and relative coming in to visit you, speak to them loudly, telling them what you want them to know as you are dying.</p>

    <h3 id="H3">Stay Hungry</h3>
    <p>Create a vision of who you want to be, and then live into that picture as if it were already true.</p>
    <p>Have something to wake up for in the morning. Something that you are “up to” in life so that you will stay hungry.</p>
    <p>Create that vision right now. Don’t live a moment longer without one. Watch what being hungry to live that vision does to your ability to
    motivate yourself.
</p>

    <h4 id="H4">Tell Yourself A True Lie</h4>
    <p>By "lying” to yourself, you are creating a vision of who you want to be.</p>
    <p>Many people are unable to see the truth of who they could be. An easy way is to express it as a fantasy</p>
    <p>Without a picture of your highest self, you can’t live into that self. Fake it
    till you make it. The lie will become the truth.</p>

    <h5 id="H5">Keep Youe Eyes On The Prize</h5>
    <p>Focus is everything. "The team that is more focused today is the team that will win the game.”</p>
    <p>Many tend to lose focus in life because they’re perpetually worried about so many negative possibilities</p>
    <p>When you focus on what you want, it will come into your life. When you focus on being a happy and mo-
    tivated person, that is who you will be.</p>

    <h6 id="H6">Simplify Your Life</h6>
    <p>One of the benefits of creatively planning your life is that it allows you to simplify. </p>
    <p>You can weed out, delegate, and eliminate all activities that don’t contribute to your projected goals.</p>
    <p>fuse all small tasks together and make the doing of them one task so that you can have more time for yourself.</p>
